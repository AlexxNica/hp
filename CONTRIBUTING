To add packages to Host & Platform, edit the README.md file.

Add the binary package, along with a rationale justifying its
inclusion, to an appropriate section of the document.  Make sure
you use the proper syntax -- it matters.  The rest of the file
can serve as an example.

Once you're happy with it, run "make -B" to regenerate the
toplevel package lists and module data files.

Note: due to various reasons, the generated toplevel lists
cannot be used with `baseruntime-package-lists` directly and
need to be altered with "make hack" first.  Don't commit such
altered versions to the repo; this is meant to be a temporary
workaround.
